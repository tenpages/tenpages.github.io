This is a personal blog of Shuo Liu (刘硕). I'm currently (2019-) a PhD student in [computer science](https://cs.georgetown.edu/) at [Georgetown University](https://www.georgetown.edu). Prior to this, I was a master student at Georgetown in CS (2017-2019), and bachelor student at [Fudan University](http://www.fudan.edu.cn/) in [mathematics](http://math.fudan.edu.cn/) (2013-2017).

During my master's degree, I was advised by Prof. [Lisa Singh](http://people.cs.georgetown.edu/~singh/) and graduated with thesis "*[Understanding Relational Background Knowledge Attacks on Social Media](https://repository.library.georgetown.edu/handle/10822/1054915)*". We studied privacy concerns of social media users, specifically web footprints that users may leave on websites unintentionally, using data scince approaches.

The title of my undergraduate thesis is "*Estimation of sparse graph with* lifecycle", advised by Prof. Yun Xiong at Fudan University and Prof. Xiangnan Kong at Worcester Polytechnic Institute.

My first name in chinese 硕 consists of two parts, 石 (sounds Shi, meaning "stone") and 页 (meaning "page"). 石 shares the same sound with 十 (meaning "ten"), and from these I get my online nickname "tenpages". (Yeah I know it's complicated.) (Yeah I have indeed also considered something like "stone page".)
