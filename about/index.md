This is a personal blog of Shuo Liu (刘硕). I obtained my PhD in [Computer Science](https://cs.georgetown.edu/) at [Georgetown University](https://www.georgetown.edu) (2019-2024), studying resilient distributed algorithms, advised by Prof. [Nitin Vaidya](https://disc.georgetown.domains/), with dissertation "*[Redundancy in Resilient Distributed Optimization and Related Problems](https://repository.digital.georgetown.edu/handle/10822/1100231)*". Prior to this, I obtained my master's degree in CS at Georgetown (2017-2019), and my bachelor's degree at [Fudan University](http://www.fudan.edu.cn/) in [mathematics](http://math.fudan.edu.cn/) (2013-2017).

During my pursuit of the master's degree, my advisor was Prof. [Lisa Singh](http://people.cs.georgetown.edu/~singh/), with the help of whom I graduated with thesis "*[Understanding Relational Background Knowledge Attacks on Social Media](https://repository.library.georgetown.edu/handle/10822/1054915)*". We studied privacy concerns of social media users, specifically web footprints that users may leave on websites unintentionally, using data scince approaches.

The title of my undergraduate thesis is "*Estimation of sparse graph with* lifecycle". My advisor was Prof. Yun Xiong at Fudan University.

My given name in chinese 硕 consists of two parts, 石 (sounds Shi, meaning "stone") and 页 (meaning "page"). 石 shares the same sound with 十 (meaning "ten"), and from these I get my online nickname "tenpages". (Yeah I know it's a little confusing.) (And yeah I have also considered something like "stone page".)

## Random stuff

I made a [web app](https://tenpages.github.io/us-level/us.html) ([github](https://github.com/tenpages/us-level)) for marking traveling experience in US and Europe that accidentally went viral for a week or so - and learned a little javascript when doing it.
