This is a personal blog of Shuo Liu. I'm currently (2019-) a PhD student in <a href="https://cs.georgetown.edu/">computer science at Georgetown University</a>. Prior to this, I was a master student at Georgetown in CS (2017-2019), and bachelor student at <a href="http://math.fudan.edu.cn/">Fudan University in mathematics</a> (2013-2017).
